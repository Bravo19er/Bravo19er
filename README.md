# Hi, I'm Bravo19er

I build mobile-friendly, open-source tools that help people work better — with clarity, flexibility, and a mindset for what's coming next.

### Current Projects

- [**AI-Ready Workspace**](https://github.com/Bravo19er/ai-ready-workspace)  
  Migration toolkit for transitioning from Microsoft 365 to Google Workspace with AI-readiness in mind.

- [**MD Tools Mobile**](https://github.com/Bravo19er/md-tools-mobile)  
  Practical markdown templates for freelancers, devs, and creators — built for speed and mobile-first editing.

### What I Focus On

- Simplicity over complexity
- Tools that support transition, not distraction
- Empowering small teams and solo builders
